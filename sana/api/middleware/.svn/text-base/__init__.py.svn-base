Simple core middleware implementations.

The sub-packages of the api middleware provide:
1.  echo-useful for testing. Returns data as json text
2.  http-extend this if you need to pass data on unchanged to a remote 
    http server


See sana.middleware.README for a description of how to add custom middleware.
